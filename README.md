Frequently, on big teams on daily-meetings presenting member work status took very long time because team became discussing and long speach on different themes...

To try to prevent that born that very simple script to show 2 minutes countdown in board header:

That is pretty simple, just few highlights:
1. Counter starts automatically by changing filter (e.g. step to next teammate). But also has manual reset button
2. Last 10 seconds highlighted in different red color
